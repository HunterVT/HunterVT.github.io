Authors: Tyler Mak, Isai Foglesong, Javin Solmirin, Alvin Wu, Shane Baclig, Ronan Russel Andal, Hunter Von Tungeln

## Overview
<em>The Problem:</em> Some people may find the gym intimidating or are afraid to go by themselves. This means they are missing out on great benefits for their health and well-being. 

<em>The Solution:</em> Rec Center Warriors is a way for UHM students to find a WRC gym partner or group of people to go to the WRC with.
