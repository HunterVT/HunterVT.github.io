When I was a little kid, around five years old, I asked my dad what I should be when I grew up. He was very shocked to hear me ask that question, given how young I was. He then asked what I liked to do, and I told him I loved playing video games. What responded with has stuck with me to this very day, which was "Well, maybe you should be the person that makes the video games." This set me on my path and motivated me into majoring in computer science and pursuing a career in software development. I want to develop software to solve real-world problems.

In the near future, I would like to develop myself in multiple ways. I want to better understand how to approach problems and solve them with programming. I want to understand the software development life cycle. I want more exposure to different technologies and understand their use cases. I want to experience an in-person hackathon. The list goes on and on. Overall, I want to develop myself as a whole with regards to software development.  

With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, I want to better my understanding of how they work on a deeper level. By understanding these new and exciting technologies, I will be more valuable and versatile as a developer. Understanding these technologies will also allow me to combine my two interests together, those being software development and the sport of powerlifting. In the future, I want to develop a piece of software that uses machine learning techniques to identify trends in powerlifting and optimize training. This would unite my two interests and provide something that powerlifting does not have much of, that being advanced research utilizing machine learning. 

All in all, I need to focus on bettering myself in present in order to fulfill my future goals. By focusing on what I can do in the present to better myself, I will gain new skills and experiences that I can use and learn from for the future.
